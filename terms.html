          <p class="text-gray-600">

    <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Guaranteed Lead Growth Assurance</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            We guarantee that your website will generate between <strong>10 to 100+ qualified leads per week</strong>, depending on the SEO service tier selected. These leads are defined as measurable user interactions through your website (e.g., form submissions, calls, messages, or WhatsApp clicks) and are tracked through tools like Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, and other conversion tracking systems.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mt-2">
            <li>The guaranteed lead range is determined by the specific service plan agreed upon at contract start.</li>
            <li>Leads will be tracked using industry-standard analytics and custom event tracking systems provided by us or mutually agreed upon.</li>
            <li>If the guaranteed lead volume is not met by the end of the contract term, and all terms are fulfilled, you are eligible for a full refund of the service fees paid during the contract period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Contract durations and lead benchmarks vary based on the SEO service level selected:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Local SEO:</strong> Minimum 9-month contract, targeting 10 leads per week. The lead guarantee will begin after the initial implementation phase (within 90 days), once all onboarding steps, access to platforms, and baseline technical SEO adjustments have been completed. Additionally, a post-implementation indexing and ranking period (up to 30 days) is allowed before lead tracking begins. The agreement will automatically renew unless either party provides written notice to terminate prior to renewal.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional SEO:</strong> Minimum 12-month contract, targeting 40 leads per week. The lead guarantee will begin after the implementation phase (within 180 days), once all onboarding steps are completed. An additional period of up to 45 days may follow to allow for Google indexing and search visibility improvements before lead tracking begins. The agreement will automatically renew unless either party provides written notice to terminate prior to renewal.</li>
            <li><strong>National SEO:</strong> Minimum 18-month contract, targeting 100+ leads per week. The lead guarantee will begin after an extended implementation phase (within 365 days), followed by a strategic SEO maturation period of up to 180 days to allow for national-level indexing and ranking improvements. Lead tracking will commence once both phases are complete. The agreement will automatically renew unless either party provides written notice to terminate prior to renewal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">To qualify for the refund, the following conditions must be met:</p>
